# FaceSimilarity
Finding human face similarity by neural network (ML)

I choosed 1174 thumbernail images from this link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/greatgamedota/ffhq-face-data-set and added them into data/example folder.
You should add target person images into data/person folder. This images will be training data. 50 images get good result.
Also, for predicting, you should add a few images of target person that are different than training images ( person folder images).
It will find similarty percentage.
